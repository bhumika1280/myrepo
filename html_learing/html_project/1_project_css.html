    <p style="color: darkcyan;">Machine Learning tutorial covers basic and advanced concepts, 
        specially designed to cater to both students and experienced working professionals.
        This machine learning tutorial helps you gain a solid introduction to the
        fundamentals of machine learning and explore a wide range of techniques,   
        including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.</p>
    <img src="ML-Tutorial.jpg" alt="ai image">
    <p>Machine learning (ML) is a subdomain of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing 
        systems that learn—or improve performance—based on the data they ingest. 
        Artificial intelligence is a broad word that refers to systems or machines that resemble 
        human intelligence. Machine learning and AI are frequently discussed together, and 
        the terms are occasionally used interchangeably, although they do not signify the same thing. 
        A crucial distinction is that, while all machine learning is AI, not all AI is machine learning.

    <h2>What is machine learning?</h2>
    <p class="paraclass">
        Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
        ML is one of the most exciting technologies that one would have ever come across. 
        As it is evident from the name, it gives the computer that makes it more similar to humans:The ability to learn. 
        Machine learning is actively being used today, perhaps in many more places than one would expect.

    <h2>Features of Machine Learning</h2>
    
    <article id="article1">Learning is a data-driven technology. 
        A large amount of data is generated by organizations daily, 
        enabling them to identify notable relationships and make better decisions.
        Machines can learn from past data and automatically improve their performance.
        Given a dataset, ML can detect various patterns in the data.
        For large organizations, branding is crucial, and targeting a relatable customer base becomes easier.
        It is similar to data mining, as both deal with substantial amounts of data.
